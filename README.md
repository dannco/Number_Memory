# Number_Memory
Android application to test and practice short-term memory


Tests a user's short term memory by quickly flashing numbers one by one on the screen, and then asking the user to enter the 
sequence that was displayed to them.  
The setup menu allows the user to adjust the length of the sequence, and the duration that each number is displayed on the screen.  
The application has a rudimentary scoring system based on the difficulty of the test and how many numbers the user got right.
